Hello!! This is an e-commerce app with basic UI and backend services with the help of Firebase.
The application's backbone is Flutter.
Flutter is very flexible as the same codebase is maintained for every platform such as Android, IOS, Linux, etc.

My application is called Som Kart. It has a basic user-friendly UI, full backend support. It has a SignIn, SignUp, Home pages, and many more. 
This application can be developed and can be improved.   
For state management, I have used Flutter GetX. Because it has a lot of features and is easy to use.

Here are instructions to  run my Som Kart:-

Step 1:- Install the application.‚è≠Ô∏è
Step 2:- For new users sign up by clicking on the SignUp button.‚è≠Ô∏è
Step 3:- Register yourself and you will enter the application.‚è≠Ô∏è
Step 4:- Now you can explore the application.

Thank You 
Someshwar Karmakar üë®‚Äçüíª
